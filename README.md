# ISA Management System

C# Windows Forms Application and MS Access for front-end.

MS Access database used to store and manage information relating to ISA savings accounts within a fictitious bank.  It is intended only for teaching purposes, to help demonstrate methods and principles in Information Systems and relational database design. It tries to reflect some of the ‘rules’ associated with real ISA savings accounts, but it is by no means an accurate model.
